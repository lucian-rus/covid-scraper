### covid-scraper

**Reasoning**
This Python application represents a web scraper that was designed to scrape data about COVID-19 from the website https://www.worldometers.info/. The idea was born from a personal desire to study the evolution of the virus by monitoring the daily evolution of the number of new cases in my home country. 

**Application overview**
Currently, the application scrapes 6 points of interest:
    * the name of the country 'country_name'
    * the total number of cases in the given country 'total_cases'
    * the number of new cases in the given country 'new_cases'
    * the total number of deaths in the given country 'total_deaths'
    * the number of new deaths in the given country 'new_deaths'
    * the population of the country 'population'
What to expect from further updates to this project:
    * local database containing data from previously scraped days
    * integrated statistics
    * more user control regarding what is being scraped and how it is stored and displayed
    * fully automated scraping at a user defined time rate
    * *maybe a GUI*


**note**: the specific webpage that is being parsed by this application can be found [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). *This project is currently work in progress.*
